# Salary Prediction using Support Vector Regression (SVR)

## Overview
This project utilizes Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict salaries based on position levels. It includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and visualization using Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project (`salary2.csv`) contains information about employees' position levels and corresponding salaries.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
3. Run the `salary_prediction.py` script.

## Files
- `salary_prediction.py`: Main Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and visualization.
- `salary2.csv`: Dataset used in the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation file (you're currently reading it).

## Usage
1. Run the `salary_prediction.py` script to execute the entire process.
2. Adjust parameters, such as the file path or SVR kernel, as needed.

## Results
The script generates visualizations, including scatter plots of the actual data points, the SVR prediction line, and a heatmap showing the correlation between features.
